            <p>This site is one of the three sample apps from <a href="https://learningpwa.com"
                    target="_blank"><em>Learning Progressive Web Apps</em></a> by John M. Wargo. The book uses this
                sample to demonstrate how to implement:
                <ul>
                    <li>Service workers in Chapter 3 </li>
                    <li>Caching strategies in Chapter 4</li>
                    <li>Offline sync in Chapter 5</li>
                </ul>

                <p>When building apps targeting desktops, laptops, smartphones, and tablets, developers have generally
                    two options to use when building their apps: native apps built specifically for the target platform,
                    or web apps which ultimately can run on most any system due to the abstraction layer provided by web
                    browsers. Building native apps for any target platform is a time-consuming and expensive
                    proposition, especially when your app targets multiple types of systems (desktop computers,
                    smartphones, televisions, etc.).</p>

                <p>Web apps were challenging because a user’s experience could vary dramatically depending on which type
                    of system the user accessed the app from. Desktop browsers are fully capable, but mobile device
                    browsers have limitations due to reduce screen real estate, processor speed, network bandwidth, and
                    more. Many of these limitations have disappeared, but there’s still considerable disparity between
                    native app and web app capabilities.</p>

                <p>What developers and users need is a way to enable web apps to work more like native apps. If we had
                    that, our web apps would soar and enable us to more easily deliver cross platform apps through the
                    browser rather than hand-crafting native apps for each supported platform.</p>

                <p>Over the years, web browsers, especially those running on mobile devices like smartphones and
                    tablets, started exposing more native capabilities to web apps. For example, modern web apps can
                    access the device’s file system and let a browser-based app know the device’s geolocation. This
                    enables web apps to work more like native apps, but there were still limitations. Service Workers
                    are a relatively new technology that make it easier for web apps to bridge the gap between native
                    and web capabilities, removing many limitations from web apps.</p>

                <p>This is a book about service workers.</p>

                <p>Yes, I know, the title says the book is about Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), and it is, but the book
                    focuses on how to use service workers to enhance the capabilities of a web app and create PWAs.</p>

                <p>There are several books out there that focus on the engagement impact of PWAs; how to build PWAs that
                    delight and inspire users to do more in the app. This isn’t that kind of book.</p>

                <p>This book is focused as much as possible on the technologies enabling PWAs, and how to use them to
                    enhance your web apps to deliver a more native-like experience in your web apps.</p>

                <p>The sample apps for this book were written specifically to be simple and easy to understand, so
                    they’re not fancy. I could have built them as amazing, reactive, modern web apps, leveraging
                    JavaScript frameworks like VueJS or React, but instead I built them using plain, vanilla HTML, CSS
                    and JavaScript. Taking approach removes a lot of extraneous code from the apps and leaves just what
                    you need to understand the topic at hand.</p>

                <p>You can find all of the source code for the sample apps on
                    <a href="https://github.com/johnwargo/learning-pwa-code" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Unlike the
                    source code repositories for
                    other books,
                    the book’s source code doesn’t contain only before and after versions of the apps. Instead, as you
                    complete a chapter section, you’ll find the source code modifications for just that section in a
                    separate file. This enables you to more easily build the app along with the chapter content while
                    having just that section’s code available in case you have an issue and want to compare the
                    completed code with yours. This approach should streamline your following-along, especially if you
                    create typos or bugs as you work.</p>

                <p>If you have any questions or comments about the book or if you found an error in the manuscript or
                    code, please submit them through the <a href="https://github.com/johnwargo/learning-pwa-code/issues"
                        target="_blank">Issues</a> area in the book’s GitHub repository. The code there is
                    open source, so feel free to use it in your applications (it would be especially nice if you
                    referenced the source for the code so others can learn about this book).</p>

                <p>If you find a bug in the code and want to fix it yourself, do so, then submit a pull request against
                    the repo and I’ll take a look. I’m usually very good about responding, so you should hear back from
                    me in a day or so. Please be nice – GitHub is a very public forum and we should all treat people
                    there as we expect to be treated by others.</p>

                <p>I believe in progressive web apps and think they are the future of mobile app development, so that’s
                    why I worked to put this book into your hands. I really enjoyed writing it, and I hope you enjoy
                    reading it as much or more.</p>
